<!-- The name of the xml must match the video or folder name. -->

<!-- "image number" sets the limit of how many covers to cycle through randomly. -->
<!-- An image must share the same name as xml but with a "_xx" e.g. Owarimonogatari_01.jpg -->
<!-- Both PNG and JPEG will work, but it looks for the .jpg extension only. -->

<!-- "year" is a string that can contain info such as runtime or number of episodes. -->
<!-- "desc" is the short description of the content, linebreaks are unavailable, length depends on the current font. -->

<!-- Certain characters are unavailable due to the XML format, use escaped versions instead. -->
<!-- Example: quotes = &#34; but for readability use &quot; and for ampersand &amp; -->

<!-- Everything else is unused, and only for WiiMC to detect the format. -->
